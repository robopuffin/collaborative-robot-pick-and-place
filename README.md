# Collaborative Pick-and-Place Robot System (Industrial Handoff Use Case)

This project explores the design of a collaborative robotic system for picking parts from a conveyor and handing them to a human coworker in a shared industrial workspace. The robot is designed with safety, flexibility, and maintainability in mind — focusing on safe human interaction, fast cycle time, and robust grasping of delicate or irregular parts.

The system emphasizes modular architecture and long-term viability, including provisions for:

- ✅ Scalable perception pipelines
- ✅ ML-based object detection and grasp planning
- ✅ Rapid retraining and onboarding of new parts
- ✅ Maintainable calibration and diagnostic procedures

While many robotic projects prioritize immediate physical implementation, this effort takes a **simulation- and analysis-first approach**, accelerating design iteration and de-risking core technologies before hardware deployment.

## Highlights

- Realistic design of an integrated robotic cell for collaborative part handling
- Use of ROS 2-based software stack, 3D perception, and ML-enhanced grasp planning
- Rigorous calibration, timing analysis, and validation test protocols
- Lifecycle maintainability focus: modular sensors, diagnostics, and reconfigurability
