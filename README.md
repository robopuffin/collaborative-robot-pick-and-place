# Collaborative Pick-and-Place Robot System (Industrial Handoff Use Case)

This project explores the design of a collaborative robotic system for picking parts from a conveyor and handing them to a human coworker in a shared industrial workspace. The robot is designed with safety, flexibility, and maintainability in mind — focusing on safe human interaction, fast cycle time, and robust grasping of delicate or irregular parts.

The system emphasizes modular architecture and long-term viability, including provisions for:

- Scalable perception pipelines
- ML-based object detection and grasp planning
- Rapid retraining and onboarding of new parts
- Maintainable calibration and diagnostic procedures

While many robotic projects prioritize immediate physical implementation, this effort takes a simulation- and analysis-first approach, accelerating design iteration and de-risking core technologies before hardware deployment.

## Highlights

- Realistic design of an integrated robotic cell for collaborative part handling
- Use of ROS2-based software stack, 3D perception, and machine learning-enabled vision
- Rigorous calibration, timing analysis, and test protocols for validating safety and reliability
- Planning for lifecycle maintainability, including modular sensors, updatable software, and diagnostic hooks
